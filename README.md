# Electrical-Vehicle-Specs
Analysis and interactive dashboard for 2025 Electric Vehicle specifications using data cleaning, regression, clustering (KMeans), and visualization with Streamlit.

# Electric Vehicle Specs Analysis and Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes electric vehicle specifications from a 2025 dataset. It covers data cleaning, exploratory visualization, and machine learning techniques including regression and KMeans clustering. An interactive Streamlit dashboard allows users to explore EV specifications, filter by features, and visualize clusters.

## Dataset
The dataset used is **Electric Vehicle Specs Dataset (2025)** from Kaggle. It includes features such as battery capacity, range, top speed, acceleration, drivetrain, and more for various EV models.

You can download the dataset here: [Kaggle Electric Vehicle Specs 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/urvishahir/electric-vehicle-specifications-dataset-2025)

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis with box plots and scatter plots  
- Regression model to predict EV range based on specifications  
- KMeans clustering to group similar EV models  
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard with filters and cluster visualization
